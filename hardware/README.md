## Overview

All schematic and PCB layouts are designed with Altium Designer. The table below summarizes the hardware projects within this folder.

| Project  | Description |
|----------|----------|
| DetectorOptode    | Sensor PCB with only photodiode detection |
| STLINK_Breakout    | Breakout PCB to be able to program STM32 Microcontrollers with any STLINK/STM32 NUCLEO |
| SourceOptode    | Sensor PCB with only emitters |
| fNIRS_CableAssembly    | Wire harness schematics used in the final product |
| fNIRS_ECU    | The electrical control unit (ECU) PCB for the entire fNIRS device |
| fNIRS_sensor_module    | Sensor PCB with both detector and emitter (main sensor PCB) |
