## Project Overview

This project introduces a low-cost, ergonomic functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) device designed for real-time brain activity monitoring. fNIRS is a non-invasive technique that uses near-infrared light to measure changes in blood oxygenation, providing insights into neural activity based on the modified Beer-Lambert Law.

While conventional fNIRS systems are expensive, bulky, and limited to clinical environments, this system is designed to be accessible, accurate, and user-friendlyâ€”ideal for education, personal health tracking, and portable research applications.

### System Highlights

- 24 custom sensor modules supporting 24 detectors and 8 dual-wavelength LED emitters (660 nm & 990 nm)
- Custom electrical control unit (ECU) built around a low-power STM32 microcontroller (STM32L476RET6) that interfaces with all sensor modules for synchronized control and data acquistion
- Ergonomic mechanical design for secure, comfortable wear during extended sessions
- Interactive Python-based GUI for live data visualization, serial communication, and module control
