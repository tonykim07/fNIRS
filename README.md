# fNIRS

**Project Overview**

This project introduces a low-cost, ergonomic functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) device designed for real-time brain activity monitoring. fNIRS is a non-invasive technique that uses near-infrared light to measure changes in blood oxygenation, providing insights into neural activity based on the modified Beer-Lambert Law.

While conventional fNIRS systems are expensive, bulky, and limited to clinical environments, this system is designed to be accessible, accurate, and user-friendlyâ€”ideal for education, personal health tracking, and portable research applications.

**System Highlights**

- 24 custom sensor modules:
- 16 photodiode detector boards
- 8 emitter-detector boards with dual-wavelength LEDs (660 nm & 940 nm)

**Custom ECU**

- Built around a low-power STM32 microcontroller
- Interfaces with all sensor modules for synchronized control and data acquisition
- Ergonomic mechanical design for secure, comfortable wear during extended sessions
- Interactive Python-based GUI for live data visualization, serial communication, and module control
